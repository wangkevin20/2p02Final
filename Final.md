# abstract
Social media is well known as the tool students use to procrastinate on their assignments or when they're bored but with how easy it is to use. There are complications online that would not have to happen in real life. There are terms such as Cancel Culture or “social justice warriors” where groups would deliberately ruin or find faults in the user's feed so that their reputation can be ruined via the use of the internet. 

# introduction
Technology become a staple in our everyday lives as the rise of the internet provides access to a wider and more connected network to allow for better access to information and resources. This shift has affected how society was governed, especially since nowadays everything is digital, with social media being the primary cause. Platforms such as Facebook and Reddit promote moderated interactions between their users, however, Twitter isn’t the case as the site’s notorious for the cancel culture surrounding it. The rise of ‘cancel culture’ of Twitter made it one of the most toxic communities to be a part of. One of the reasons why cancel culture is so prevalent is due to the stubborn nature of netizens, who often refuse to take in various perspectives and approach a problem from a different direction. The lack of an attempt at better understanding is what has caused them to develop the belief that their methods are superior. Another is the users who find pleasure in continuing hate speech, adding controversial statements to keep community controversy active. If one were to look up the latest news of cancel culture, they would typically find celebrities in the top trending, which would often attract more attention as people are easily intrigued by celebrity news, especially due to how easy it is to find these articles and news. Rather there rarely is news about the livelihood of smaller creators/businesses being affected, despite being as important or similar to the big celebrity cases who are much more popular. 

To us now, toxicity or bullying is a norm, especially on social platforms. Almost every day there is some kind of controversy or situation where people get too riled up for little to no particular reason. These kinds of scenarios bring unwanted toxicity and drama into these platforms which originally served the purpose of sharing and communication, not negativity and hate speech. There are justifiable accusations on the platform, but the ones that are the most interactive were misinterpretations or genuine mistakes that did not mean any harm caused by the user. These misinterpretations or false claims can lead to the start of a cancel culture yet when one would call out, reform, or admit their mistakes it would be too late for a conclusion acceptable by the online community. That's how the worst of cancel culture affects those who made a mistake online, shut down, and are unable to be forgiven by the mass community, with their drama eventually dying down and becoming forgotten. Twitter is by far the most notorious when it comes to drama and accidents, especially those that are centered around cancel culture. It solidified its reputation as having one of the more toxic sub-communities where all that

# Data Methods 

Twitter, despite being the top contender for being toxic, is successful as a platform due to its capabilities of being vocal and engaging. The hashtags on the site work as a profile to bring the smaller voices up such as #BlackLivesMatter. It can bring the mainstream media’s attention to what would normally be a small voice. Media attention is one of the primary reasons why there are many instances of cancel culture. It is said that the more attention and people that flock around the problem, the bigger it becomes and the more likely that it will escalate. Twitter also has an engagement aspect where one would generally continue the conversation, political or not. 

## Question data and tools used
There are users who may not have used Twitter but are aware of its bad reputation, where that fact alone changes how users see the platform. It’s better for participants to gather data on what a community thinks of the platform as it can give some small insight about the platform as a whole, and how it’s perceived. This could be about famous celebrities, companies, fandoms, movements/events, ETC

Rather than analyzing the data of a single incident, it would be better for the participants to analyze Twitter's platform as a whole and see what they view as cancel culture. Instead of focusing on a single subject, it may be more effective for them to be more vocal about multiple topics, and by having a broader data spread discussions can be said about the nature of why these moments have to happen. These events or findings can be categorized by using Timeline, to organize the participant's findings in a more stylized and detailed look. There may also be particularly different reasons why one would type, such as different political viewpoints, not having a different opinion, being dissatisfied with something, or even writing controversy to generate more promotion for themselves.

# results and analysis
When putting up the results of what we could find, we can conclude that the topic of just cancel culture itself is too broad, and diving too deep into individual issues can become too complex where it cannot be put into simpler terms. In cases where trolling, bullying and repeated harassment have become the norm, cancel culture seems to have become pointless in comparison to the original objective. Often through past tweets or actions that don’t define the people who made them anymore, cancel culture is the step by step definition of refusing to believe that people and society can change, and punishing them for mistakes that were made long ago. Despite most of the tweets being sarcastic or not really needing people to cancel/overact, there was a specific tweet of an artist redrawing a female black character as a monkey that gained a lot of attraction. The users themselves posted this as an extremely satirical joke about artists doing fan drawing of black characters that got canceled due to said character not being “black” enough. The tweet went viral and it was no surprise that there was a time gap between the user's feed and posts as it has most likely been deleted now. It was a joke that seemed a bit too harmful due to many people stating that the artwork was discriminatory towards blacks due to the stereotypes of them being savages/apes but some defended the piece as a satirical piece to bait people into spreading the word of his work. 

This was an interesting post due to how a majority of participants agreed about how the nature of that art piece was the middle ground in the discussion. It was prevalent that the user was not a racist and was doing this piece as satirical but shows itself in a bad light as it presented itself in a space where the people were already debating about colour, adding needless oil to the fire. If things went too out of hand then the user would have to face situations that would escalate into real-world issues such as people finding their IPs or sending death threats. This discussion between the participants shows how complex cancel culture can be. That the line which separates them shifts and changes for each individual. The discussion from before mentions both the group that felt the need to attack and those who defended the users are both somewhat valid. There is more than one factor when it comes to the final outcome of being canceled, it can be light or life-ending depending on the situation and its severity in the public eye. The artist who posted the monkey piece from a technical standpoint did nothing wrong and was just posting a satirical piece but due to the group he angered, through sheer numbers, he was forced to take it down after being suspended for three days.

# discussion/conclusion
In a sense, Cancel Culture is a complex topic whose standpoint changes depending on individuals or groups. Those who target users with the intention of cancel culture could also be not meant to be taken seriously or overly dramatic but occasionally can have a good reason if needed. With how cancel culture is rooted in our society, the meaning of its action and understanding is still too complex to be understood. There are many takes of canceling that understanding means to take and understand the views of everything surrounding it. The Twitter platform wasn’t always like it is but this could be said from the current years as well as in the past, many things that we can’t say now were acceptable back then. 
 
Most can agree that during the upcoming years people are going to become more soft or uptight about what we can say or type, without making the subject matter too seriously. The appropriation for writing one’s opinion online has become too guarded or strict to the extent where ‘free speech’ only exists at a superficial level where, users don’t really post about what they want but instead, go with the majority perspective and do not really voice their own opinion due to fear of backlash. The issue does not stem from the technological age as this was also
