# abstract
Social media is well known as the tool students use to procrastinate on their assignments or when they're bored but with how easy it is to use. There are complications online that would not have to happen in real life. There are terms such as Cancel Culture or “social justice warriors” where groups would deliberately ruin or find faults in the user's feed so that their reputation can be ruined via the use of the internet. 

# introduction
Technology become a staple in our everyday lives as the rise of the internet provides access to a wider and more connected network to allow for better access to information and resources. This shift has affected how society was governed, especially since nowadays everything is digital, with social media being the primary cause. Platforms such as Facebook and Reddit promote moderated interactions between their users, however, Twitter isn’t the case as the site’s notorious for the cancel culture surrounding it. The rise of ‘cancel culture’ of Twitter made it one of the most toxic communities to be a part of. One of the reasons why cancel culture is so prevalent is due to the stubborn nature of netizens, who often refuse to take in various perspectives and approach a problem from a different direction. The lack of an attempt at better understanding is what has caused them to develop the belief that their methods are superior. Another is the users who find pleasure in continuing hate speech, adding controversial statements to keep community controversy active. If one were to look up the latest news of cancel culture, they would typically find celebrities in the top trending, which would often attract more attention as people are easily intrigued by celebrity news, especially due to how easy it is to find these articles and news. Rather there rarely is news about the livelihood of smaller creators/businesses being affected, despite being as important or similar to the big celebrity cases who are much more popular. 

To us now, toxicity or bullying is a norm, especially on social platforms. Almost every day there is some kind of controversy or situation where people get too riled up for little to no particular reason. These kinds of scenarios bring unwanted toxicity and drama into these platforms which originally served the purpose of sharing and communication, not negativity and hate speech. There are justifiable accusations on the platform, but the ones that are the most interactive were misinterpretations or genuine mistakes that did not mean any harm caused by the user. These misinterpretations or false claims can lead to the start of a cancel culture yet when one would call out, reform, or admit their mistakes it would be too late for a conclusion acceptable by the online community. That's how the worst of cancel culture affects those who made a mistake online, shut down, and are unable to be forgiven by the mass community, with their drama eventually dying down and becoming forgotten. Twitter is by far the most notorious when it comes to drama and accidents, especially those that are centered around cancel culture. It solidified its reputation as having one of the more toxic sub-communities where all that
